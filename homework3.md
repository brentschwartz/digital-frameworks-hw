NFL Owners and Campaign Donations





I also found information non some non-owners in the NFL, that made donations. Current Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin donated $2,700 to Hillary Clinton. Tomlin's boss, Dan Rooney (who passed away three months ago) has given donations to democrats, and was the creator of the progressive "Rooney Rule," which requires NFL franchises to interview at least one minority head coaching candidate. Tomlin, who was hired by Rooney, is African-American, and has led the Steelers to two Super Bowls (winning one) since being hired in 2007.
