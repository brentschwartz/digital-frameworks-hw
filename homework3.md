NFL Owners and Campaign Donations

Through several browser searches and information-scavenging, I was able to find campaign donation data on 13 of the 32 NFL owners, in relation to Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and the 2016 presedential election. 

The numbers are about as you'd expect. 

But the exact numbers I found are staggering. From what I found, NFL owners donated $5,415,400 to Trump's campaign. But NFL owners' donations to Hillary? They totaled at just $19,900. That is truly insane. 

Keep in mind this was just the information I was able to uncover. 

It's expected that rich, billionaire NFL owners might swing toward a conservative candidate. They have a lot of money, and want that money to stay intact, with little government interference (tax). But these numebrs are nuts. 

Here is a chart I made containing the information I found:


NFL Owners		                    Trump	     Hillary
			
Edward Glazer (Tampa Bay)		    $55,400 	   $5,400 
Steve Tisch (NY Giants)			                 $2,700 
Jeffrey Lurie (Philadelphia)			           $2,700 
Bob McNair (Houston)		      $254,600 	
Woody Johnson (NY Jets)		    $100,000 	
Red McCombs (Minnesota)		    $5,400 	
Robert Kraft (New England)		$1,000,000 	
Jerry Jones (Dallas)		      $1,000,000 	
Shahid Khan (Jaguars)		      $1,000,000 	
Stan Kroenke (Rams)		        $1,000,000 	   $2,700 
Daniel Snyder (Washington)		$1,000,000 	
Jed York (San Francisco)			               $1,000 
 Arthur Blank (Atlanta)			                 $5,400 
			
Total 		                    $5,415,400 	   $19,900 


Five NFL owners each donated $1 million to Trump, while the biggest donation to Hillary was just $5,400, the price of many used cars. 

I also found information non some non-owners in the NFL, that made donations. Current Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin donated $2,700 to Hillary Clinton. Tomlin's boss, Dan Rooney (who passed away three months ago) has given donations to democrats, and was the creator of the progressive "Rooney Rule," which requires NFL franchises to interview at least one minority head coaching candidate. Tomlin, who was hired by Rooney, is African-American, and has led the Steelers to two Super Bowls (winning one) since being hired in 2007. 

However, I could not find who Rooney donated to, or if he even donated at all. 

So we'll go with what we have. And what we have is shocking.
