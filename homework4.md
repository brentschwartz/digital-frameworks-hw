 With many NFL analysts screaming at us through the television to tell us who the best quarterback in the league is (it's Tom Brady), I decided to document and chart the passer ratings (a big stat toward a pro quarterback's resume) of Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. The chart shows Rodgers' unreal run from 2011-2014, as well as 40-year-old Brady's re-ascension (his best year was 2007, before Rodgers became an NFL starter) the last three seasons (in which he won two Super Bowls).
