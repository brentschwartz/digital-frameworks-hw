Don Bacon 

In organizing this set of data (first copied into a new Google spreadsheet, then into Microsoft Excel), I noticed my representative, Nebraska Republican Don Bacon, voted yes a ton more than the average representative in this sheet. 

Bacon voted yes on 75% of the voting scenarios, compared to rest of the representatives (57.8%). In comparison, Luis V. Gutierrez, a democratic respresentative from Illinois, voted yes on just 33% of votes (voted no (50%), meaning most voting scenearios might have involved conservatice stances, when lookig at Bacon's votes. 

That notion is furter backed when sorting South Carolina republican representative Ralph Norman's voing stats. Norman voted yes a whopping 92%. 

In looking at the data, it seems republicans voted yes mroe than democrats.
