Evolution of the Scatback


Teams mimicking Patriots as smaller, more elusive ‘scatbacks’ replacing traditional running backs due to modern NFL’s style of play, 


By Brent Schwartz



In Super Bowl LI, the Patriots struggled early to run the ball with their big bruiser, LeGarrette Blount. The team then swapped the traditional running back for smaller, more agile James White. White then played 72 percent of the team’s snaps, proving instrumental in the Patriots’ shocking comeback over the Atlanta Falcons, scoring three touchdowns. 


With the increase of passing and faster defensive talent, the NFL has gradually shifted toward fast elusive scatbacks like White. Once viewed as situational, role-type players, scatbacks today are often used as the focal running back.


“The reason why teams are leaning on that more is because it makes them more versatile offensively,” said Fox Sports NFL analyst and former NFL tight end George Wrighster. “It’s all about creating mismatches on defense.” 


The Carolina Panthers’ selection of Christian McCaffrey with the eighth overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft is the latest example of the trend. The 5-foot-11 McCaffrey, at 202 pounds, is known more for his speed (4.48 seconds in 40-yard dash), quickness and versatility rather than strength and power. 


“I think this is a guy that you can get the ball into his hands in many different ways and quick,” said Panthers head coach Ron Rivera at a press conference after the draft. 


Four spots above McCaffrey, the Jacksonville Jaguars took the now-uncommon, old-school approach, picking up Leonard Fournette (6-foot-1, 235 pounds), according to ESPN NFL Insider Scott Kacsmar.
 

“With so much passing across the league now, the days of the 300-carry, 350-touch a season running back are dying out,” said Kacsmar. “Running backs aren't any different in the way that teams are looking for capable receivers and pass protectors who can perform well on third down when most teams look to pass instead of run.”


According to statistical research done by Inside The Pylon’s Dave Archibald, seven teams clearly used specialized roles for running backs during the 2015 NFL season, including the Patriots, who benefited from scatbacks more than any team. 


Besides White, New England also employed Shane Vereen in this role during Super Bowl XLIX and Danny Woodhead in Super Bowl XLVI in 2011 as well as Kevin Faulk and J.R. Redmond in four Super Bowl appearances during the 2000s. 


“Whenever the game was on the line, whenever we weren’t running in between the guards, I was in the game,” Redmond said.


For the 2001 Patriots, the season was on the line in Super Bowl XXXVI when Brady, Redmond and the rest of the players on the field took the huddle tied 17-17 witih the St. Louis Rams with 1:21 to play. 


Brady’s next three completions were to Redmond, who fought his way out of bounds at the Patriots’ 41-yard line on his third catch, stopping the clock at 33 seconds.


“According to {Bill} Belichick and Charlie Weis it was the most pivotal play in that sequence of plays,” Redmond said. “Stopping the clock there was huge. I remember getting up field and them yelling, ‘Get out of bounds, get out of bounds.’”


Brady completed two more passes downfield to Troy Brown and Jermaine Wiggins, before Adam Vinatieri nailed the game-winning 48-yard field goal. The usage of Redmond set the tone for scatbacks in future Patriots’ Super Bowls, leading up White’s performance in February. 


For the Patriots, there is a striking increased usage of Scatbacks in their Super Bowls, compared to the regular season. I researched and tallied up some snap counts for the Patriots during the regular season and Super Bowl for seasons in which they made the big game. 


Let’s look at some of the numbers:

The number of snaps played by Patriots' scatbacks in Super Bowls are tremendously higher than the regular season average. The usage of scatbacks during the past three Super Bowls has increased every year, culminating in James White's performance, in which he played most of the game. 

The one minor outlier -- scatback Shane Vereen receiving the majority of the 2014 regular season snaps -- can easily be explained. 

The Patriots lost Ridley early on during the 2014 season, and had to call up Gray from the practice squad later in the year. After Gray fell out of favor, the Patriots traded for Blount late in the season to fill the traditional running back role. It's plausible to assume that had Ridley not been injured, Vereen would have not played the majority of running back snaps during the 2014 regular season. 

Teams of all leagues are always looking for a new advantage, and former NFL tight end George Wrighster says that’s scatbacks provide an advantage that’s similar to that of the defending NBA champions. 

“The league {NFL} is evolving like the NBA is,” said Wrighster. “There have always been really good three-point shooters, but no one would put four three-point shooters on the floor at once until recently. The {Golden State} Warriors shoot the ball so well that they have been able to create more space on the floor. Teams were resistant to take their big guys off the floor because they thought they had an advantage.”


In June, The Warriors won their second NBA championship in three seasons. New England has won two of the past three Super Bowls, and five championships since 2001 in part by implementing scatbacks more than just situationally. It’s no wonder more teams are following suit.

How I did this/why I did this:

I've been studying scatbacks this summer, and talking to NFL analysts and ex-scatbacks (such as J.R. Redmond about the evolution of a role position, that is now becoming the norm for a starting position. The Patriots are leading the way in upping the importance of these guys, showcased by how they use them in Super Bowls. 

I found the regular season data and 2014/2016 Super Bowl data on Pro Football Reference's site. Excellent tool. As for the 2011 Super Bowl, I knew Woodhead was used mroe often, but had to document that data myself. So yes, I took an hour or two to shift through EVERY Patriots offense snap in Super Bowl 46 to see hwo often Green-Ellis and Woodhead were on the field. 

After 65 offensive snaps, Woodhead was on the field for 37 plays, while Green-Ellis just 23. 

Green-Ellis had mroe snaps during the regular season, but not in the big game. 

This all started when J.R. Redmond played the bulk of the Patriots running back snaps down stretch of Super Bowl 36 in 2001, the first Super Bowl victory of the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick victory in New England. 

Other teams are now following suit, as Inside the Pylon did data on the increase of scatbacks snapcounts. 

One of the biggest notions that back my story is explained in the story as well. A scatback-type player like Stanford's Christian McCaffrey would NEVER be drafted as high as he during the 2017 NFL draft. This is because his skill set is valuable and these guys are being used more in today's game.

Anyways, as I've now passed 200 words (263!),I'll say sorry I had to bore you with a football story (haha), but alas, it's what I'm good at. 

Just wanted to say thank you for teaching this class and for being lenient with my traveling throughout the summer!
